Text Analysis Toolkit
Overview
The Text Analysis Toolkit is a collection of Python scripts designed to perform various text-related tasks, including data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and topic labeling. Each script focuses on a specific aspect of text analysis and utilizes relevant libraries and techniques.

Features
The Text Analysis Toolkit includes the following features:

Data preprocessing for text analysis.
Sentiment analysis using various techniques.
Topic labeling with machine learning classifiers.
Text-to-speech (TTS) message generation for summarizing results.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before using the Text Analysis Toolkit, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python 3.x
Required Python libraries (specified in each script)
Dependencies for specific scripts (e.g., NLTK, scikit-learn)
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-analysis-toolkit.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd text-analysis-toolkit
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Script 1: Data Preprocessing and Movie Information Extraction
This script focuses on data preprocessing and extracting information about movies from a dataset. It includes functions for text preprocessing, extracting movie directors, and classifying text as reviews or mentions. It also trains a logistic regression classifier to classify text.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python script1.py --dataset dataset.csv
Script 2: Sentiment Analysis Using VADER
This script performs sentiment analysis using the VADER sentiment intensity analyzer. It preprocesses text, calculates sentiment scores, and classifies text as reviews or mentions. It also trains the sentiment analyzer on a dataset.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python script2.py --dataset dataset.csv
(Repeat the pattern for the remaining scripts, adjusting the script number and description accordingly.)

Script 7: Text-to-Speech (TTS) Message Generation
This script generates a text-to-speech (TTS) voice message using the pyttsx3 library. It composes a message with movie information and plays it using a text-to-speech engine.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python script7.py
